`TestCasePrinter` :  
To show how many test case are passed, there is java class file named __TestCasePrinter__.  
there is method name __printTestResult__ & __testResultSumup__. __printTestResult__ method count test case's number and success test number.
and __testResultSumup__ prints summary of them.

`Main` > `main()` :  
We make solving function outside of main. And we take main function as only test case input.
